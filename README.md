# Project: Bikehorn

Project Bikehorn is a content pack for Toontown Rewritten that aims to enhance the experience as faithfully as possible by using the original resolution textures released as part of the "Spotify" repo, restored music using the restored gm.dls soundfont by michael64, and eventually source quality sound effects found by The Almighty Egg.

The result is a near 1:1 idea of what a faithful modern day Toontown could've looked like, staying as true as possible to the original game.

***NOTE: DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LARGE TEXTURE SIZES OF THIS PACK, THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE OF LAG ON MID-TO-LOW-RANGE PCS. INTEL HD GRAPHICS CARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE USED WHEN RUNNING THIS PACK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

# FAQ

**Q:** How do I install this?

**A:** Grab a copy of the ZIP in the Releases section. Go to your Toontown Rewritten installation directory and make a new folder called "resources", and put the .mf file from the ZIP in the new folder you've created. Start the game, go into the Video section of the options, scroll all the way down, and tick both "Enable Experimental Settings" and "Remove Maximum Texture Size". Scroll up a tiny bit, enable "Project: Bikehorn", and finally hit "Apply".

**Q:** I found an issue/want to contribute!

**A:** Go ahead! This project is open sourced for that exact reason. Open an issue/pull request and I'll review it.

**Q:** Can I use _____?

**A:** Depending on what you're trying to use, go right ahead, but please credit these people:

### Music

* Michael64 for the gm.dls restored soundfont
* James T. Sale for the original intended music for Tug-o-War

### Sound effects

Sound effects are not implemented yet, but when they are implemented please credit The Almighty Egg for finding the original high quality sources.

### Textures

* Satire6 for their generous upload of the Spotify repo (which can be found here: https://github.com/satire6/Spotify). Without it, none of this would've ever existed!
* P3DCAT for the Pandora Palletizer tool (which can be found here: https://github.com/P3DCAT/PandoraPalettizer/).
* Toontown Texture Restoration for a couple of the palettes included in here
* Dank Mickey for the Rerigged Skelecog palettes
* toonjoey for rearranging a lot of the Pandora Palletizer palettes to be 1:1 with their original textures

**Q:** Some things look/sound a bit different from the original game. Why is that?

**A:** To enhance the experience slightly, I've made some personal edits to parts of the pack to fix some minor oversights and overall bring it closer to what I believe Disney intended.

The things changed are:

* Flipped Bossbot/Sellbot arms/legs to be consistent with the other Cog types
* The unused Tug-o-War theme has been reimplemented
* Fixed Lawbot HQ scale not displaying the emblem (credits to yippie2020!)
* Fixed the bathtub beds handles not displaying due to an alpha channel issue

It's also possible that I made a mistake. In which case, please open an issue/pull request if possible!

**Q:** Will this continue to be updated?

**A:** This is only the beginning! The current version of this pack is only *just* good enough to release. Eventually, I plan to add more palettes, fix up the music a bit, and when The Almighty Egg gets around to it, add the *original, uncompressed sound effects straight from their original libraries.* There will be a spreadsheet detailing which sound effects are or aren't used, and what libraries/companies they came from. The aim is to provide an intricately detailed community resource for all to use in their projects.

**Q:** Why do some textures look pixellated?

**A:** The Spotify repo only has content dating up to around 2008. This means things like the finalized Toon Hall, a couple minor textures for parties, and Field Offices weren't included. The original textures were used where applicable, and in most cases they were simply scaled up from their original resolutions, resulting in the pixellated look mentioned earlier.
